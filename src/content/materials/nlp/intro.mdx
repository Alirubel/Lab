# Introduction to Natural Language Processing

## What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to understand, process, and generate human language. It lies at the intersection of computer science, linguistics, and machine learning.

Unlike structured data, natural language is ambiguous, context-dependent, and highly variable, making automated processing a challenging task.

## Why NLP is Difficult

Human language contains properties that are hard to model computationally:

- Ambiguity at lexical and syntactic levels
- Long-range dependencies
- Contextual and pragmatic meaning
- Cultural and domain-specific variations

As a result, early NLP systems relied heavily on handcrafted rules and linguistic expertise.

## Evolution of NLP Methods

### Rule-Based Systems

Early NLP systems were based on manually designed grammatical and linguistic rules. These systems were interpretable but brittle and difficult to scale.

### Statistical NLP

With the availability of large corpora, probabilistic models such as Hidden Markov Models and n-gram language models became dominant. These approaches treated language as a statistical phenomenon.

### Neural NLP

Deep learning introduced distributed representations of language, enabling models to learn semantic and syntactic patterns automatically. Neural networks significantly improved performance across tasks such as translation, summarization, and question answering.

## Applications of NLP

NLP techniques are widely used in real-world applications:

- Machine translation
- Information retrieval
- Sentiment analysis
- Chatbots and conversational agents
- Text summarization

## Course Perspective

In this course, we focus on both theoretical foundations and modern neural approaches to NLP, with an emphasis on understanding model behavior rather than treating models as black boxes.
