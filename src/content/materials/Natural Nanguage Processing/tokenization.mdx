# Tokenization in Natural Language Processing

## Motivation

Tokenization is the process of breaking raw text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens serve as the basic input units for most NLP models.

Without proper tokenization, it is impossible to apply statistical or neural methods effectively.

## Types of Tokenization

### Word-Level Tokenization

In word-level tokenization, text is split into words using whitespace and punctuation. This approach is simple but struggles with unknown words and large vocabularies.

### Subword Tokenization

Subword tokenization methods address vocabulary limitations by splitting words into smaller meaningful units.

Popular algorithms include:

- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
- WordPiece
- Unigram Language Model

Subword methods are widely used in transformer-based models.

### Character-Level Tokenization

Character-level tokenization treats each character as a token. While it avoids out-of-vocabulary issues, it increases sequence length and computational cost.

## Tokenization and Model Performance

The choice of tokenization strategy has a significant impact on:

- Vocabulary size
- Training stability
- Generalization ability
- Handling of rare words

Modern language models rely heavily on carefully designed tokenization schemes.

## Practical Considerations

In practice, tokenization is tightly coupled with the pretrained model architecture and training corpus. Using mismatched tokenizers often leads to degraded performance.

## Summary

Tokenization is not a preprocessing detail but a fundamental design decision in NLP systems.
