# Introduction to Deep Learning

## Overview

Deep Learning is a class of machine learning methods based on multi-layer neural networks. These models learn hierarchical representations of data through composition of simple nonlinear transformations.

Deep learning has become the dominant paradigm for perception, language, and reasoning tasks.

## Neural Networks

### Artificial Neurons

Artificial neurons compute weighted sums of inputs followed by nonlinear activation functions. Despite their simplicity, large collections of neurons can approximate complex functions.

### Depth and Representation Learning

Deeper networks can represent more abstract features, enabling improved generalization and expressiveness compared to shallow models.

## Training Deep Networks

Training deep models involves optimizing millions or billions of parameters using gradient-based methods such as stochastic gradient descent.

Challenges include:

- Vanishing and exploding gradients
- Overfitting
- Optimization instability

Techniques such as normalization, residual connections, and regularization address these issues.

## Role in Modern AI

Deep learning serves as the backbone of modern NLP, computer vision, and reinforcement learning systems. Transformer architectures, in particular, have unified deep learning approaches across modalities.

## Course Focus

This course emphasizes conceptual understanding of deep learning mechanisms rather than mere usage of libraries.
